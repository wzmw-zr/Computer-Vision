# FCOS: Fully Convolutional One-Stage Object Detection

## 一、Abstract

1. FCOS is anchor box free, as well as proposal free, which means that:
   + it can avoid calculating overlapping during training.
   + avoid all hyper-parameters related to anchor box.
2. With NMS and ResNext, FCOS  can not only surpass previous on-stage detectors in single-model and single-scale testing, but also be much simpler.



## 二、Introduction

Though it has been long believed that the use of anchor boxes is the key to detector's success, the anchor-based detector suffer some drawbacks:
