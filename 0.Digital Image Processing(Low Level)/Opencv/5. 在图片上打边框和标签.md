# 在图片上打边框和标签

## 一、打边框`cv2.rectangle()`

```python
cv2.rectangle(image, start_point, end_point, color, thickness)
"""
Parameters:
@image: It is the image on which rectangle is to be drawn.
@start_point: It is the starting coordinates of rectangle. The coordinates are represented as tuples of two values i.e. (X coordinate value, Y coordinate value).
@end_point: It is the ending coordinates of rectangle. The coordinates are represented as tuples of two values i.e. (X coordinate value, Y coordinate value).
@color: It is the color of border line of rectangle to be drawn. For BGR, we pass a tuple. eg: (255, 0, 0) for blue color.
@thickness: It is the thickness of the rectangle border line in px. Thickness of -1 px will fill the rectangle shape by the specified color.

Return Value: It returns an image.
"""
cv2.rectangle(img, (20, 20), (300, 300), [128, 0, 0], 2)
```



## 二、打标签`cv2.putText()`

```python
cv2.putText(image, text, org, font, fontScale, color[, thickness[, lineType[, bottomLeftOrigin]]])
"""
Parameters:
@image: It is the image on which text is to be drawn.
@text: Text string to be drawn.
@org: It is the coordinates of the bottom-left corner of the text string in the image. The coordinates are represented as tuples of two values i.e. (X coordinate value, Y coordinate value).
@font: It denotes the font type. Some of font types are FONT_HERSHEY_SIMPLEX, FONT_HERSHEY_PLAIN, , etc.
@fontScale: Font scale factor that is multiplied by the font-specific base size.
@color: It is the color of text string to be drawn. For BGR, we pass a tuple. eg: (255, 0, 0) for blue color.
@thickness: It is the thickness of the line in px.
@lineType: This is an optional parameter.It gives the type of the line to be used.
@bottomLeftOrigin: This is an optional parameter. When it is true, the image data origin is at the bottom-left corner. Otherwise, it is at the top-left corner.

Return Value: It returns an image.
